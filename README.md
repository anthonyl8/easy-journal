# EasyJournal

## 5-minute summaries of cool events in life

I've realized recently that I can be quite forgetful about day-to-day events. 
One solution to this would, of course, be to start writing in a journal or a
blog, but I've always found myself not really knowing how to start with a
journal. That's why I came up with **EasyJournal**.

**EasyJournal** streamlines the journaling process. Users can commemorate events
with just a few short categorizing selections, answers to pre-written 
questions, and a couple of images. Each event will be recorded under a specific
day. The user will then be able to go into a calendar view and click into events 
logged on any day. They will also be able to see statistics about some of their 
answers for all logged events. Finally, they will be able to generate a 
slideshow of all events from start to finish, as well as a slideshow of events 
that fit under a certain filter.

I envision this application to be for people who want to be able to remember 
aspects of their lives but are too lazy or busy to write full on journal 
entries every day.
